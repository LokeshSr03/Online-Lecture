# Online-Lecture

An online lecture scheduling module allows an admin to add courses, assign them to instructors, set dates, and view a list of instructors. The instructor panel enables instructors to see their assigned courses. This module is developed using React, Chakra UI, Redux, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, and bcrypt.
